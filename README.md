🚀 Hey there! I'm a 25-year-old full-stack developer who dove into the world of web development in late 2021. 

🌐 I started with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and my first server-side programming language was PHP. I prefer understanding how things work before using a framework, so I built a mini-framework from scratch, inspired by Symfony, which included autoload, an ORM, and MVC architecture.


🎓 I obtained my Associate Degree in Computer Science in July 2022, and since September 2022, I've been working with CakePHP at [@passbolt](https://www.github.com/passbolt), where I'm pursuing a Bachelor degree in Computer Science in full-stack development through an apprenticeship.


🔧 Recently, I've been diving into JavaScript-based technologies and frameworks, starting with Node.js, then Express.js, and now Nest.js ❤️ 


💻 As for the front-end, I used to work with Twig and Bootstrap, but I've recently become interested in front-end frameworks. I've tried React, but I've found my groove with Vue.js and Nuxt 3 💚 I'm also keeping an eye on Astro.js as I've heard great things about it.


🔒 I'm passionate about writing clean, secure, and elegant code, striving to create top-notch applications for users.


🌟 I believe in giving back to the community, so I make all of my projects open-source. Some are still in development and will be open-sourced once they reach a stable version.


🛠️ My time at passbolt has helped me develop skills in support and system administration, such as working with Linux, web servers like Apache2 and Nginx, databases, proxies and reverse-proxies, WAF, Cloudflare Tunnel and containerization with Docker. I'm looking forward to learning Kubernetes in the future.

⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer bug was an actual insect? In 1947, a moth was found trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, causing an error. This event led to the term "debugging" to describe the process of finding and fixing issues in software code.
