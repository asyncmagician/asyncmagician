# Hey, I'm Antony! 👋

  ## About Me

  I'm a 28-year-old DevOps Engineer at [@passbolt](https://www.github.com/passbolt) who discovered my passion for web development in late 2020. What started as curiosity about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript quickly evolved into a deep dive into full-stack engineering.

  ### What I Do 🛠️

  I wear many hats as a true Swiss Army knife in the software lifecycle:

  - **Backend & Frontend Development**: Writing clean, secure code across the
  stack
  - **DevOps & Automation**: If I do something twice, it gets automated.
  Debian/RPM packaging, Ansible playbooks, Docker orchestration - I love making
  systems work seamlessly
  - **Infrastructure**: Building robust systems that scale predictably and remain
  secure by design
  - **Problem Solving**: From debugging container failures to untangling cryptic
  SELinux errors - these aren't obstacles, they're puzzles I enjoy solving

  ### Tech Stack 💻

  **Languages**: PHP, JavaScript, Python, Bash
  **DevOps**: Docker, Ansible, Kubernetes, CI/CD
  **Systems**: Linux (various distributions), High-availability architectures
  **Interests**: Cryptography, Algorithms, Security-first design
